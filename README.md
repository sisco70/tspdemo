# Tspdemo

Tspdemo is a java client-side application, based on Swing and Java SE 8.  
This app shows (in an interactive way) how the main "TSP related" heuristics works (Greedy, Nearest neighbor, Convex-Hull).  
We can test how works the approximation of sub-optimal solutions (2-opt, 3-opt) and calculate lower-bound (Held-Karp) for a given instance.
